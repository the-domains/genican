When we started GeniCan we knew we were onto something.  But along the 
way we've met people who have told us to keep to more traditional 
solutions, that we shouldn't attempt to be too disruptive, that "this is
not the time".  
And we think to ourselves, this is the BEST 
time.  The entire world is exploding with creativity. So many ideas are 
becoming reality so quickly and that is nothing short of inspirational. 
If you wish your TV, or your smartphone, or your KITCHEN could do 
something they are currently not capable of, now is the time for you to 
make it happen.  
Even today people tell us to give up, that it's impossible to really change anything.  
But
you know what, we've had more people tell us the opposite.  They tell 
us to keep pushing forward.  They tell us they get it and they love it 
and this is one of those products that's perfect for its time.  Thank 
you to everyone that has believed in us to this point and thank you 
Architectural Digest for joining them.    
We're still on our journey.  And we're grateful.
