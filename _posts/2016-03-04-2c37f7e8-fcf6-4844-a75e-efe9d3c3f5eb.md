What a whirlwind this trip has been.

A few months ago we were contacted by the producers of the
Science Channel's [All-American Makers][0].  They had heard
about GeniCan and wanted to determine if it was a good fit for the show. 
Honestly, we were apprehensive.  At that point we only had our prototype
and while it was a working prototype, we really would have preferred to wait
until we were ready to ship before taking advantage of an opportunity like
that.  Sometimes you just need to do things before you're ready.

One thing led to another and we found ourselves under the
lights in front of [Brook
Drumm][1] of [printrbot][2] and Brian Roe, two
seasoned hardware startup experts, and investor Marc Portney. To our side, our
fellow makers from [Boxzy][3], [Ginzvelo][4] and [Impervious][5]. 

For anyone who hasn't been behind the scenes of a TV show,
the exciting story you see on television is actually a methodical, detailed and
organized process.  All-American Makers has introductions, product
testing, elimination panels, focus groups, product shots, expert testimonials
and interviews.  Multiply that by 4 groups per show and you can imagine
how much work must go into it.  Of course there is drama in every show,
but the great thing about All-American Makers is that it celebrates American
Entrepreneurship.  It's one of the things we loved about American Makers
even before we were asked to participate.  Whenever a team is let go, it's
always with supportive words, words of encouragement.  And often on the
show, Marc invests in more than one company.  If he likes it, he supports
it.  After the initial apprehension and the trials and tribulations of the
show we are so proud to say that we won our episode of All-American
Makers! 

This adventure is full of beginnings and winning
All-American Makers is yet another one.  We learned a lot on the show and
have implemented many of their suggestions, one major suggestion being a
complete [redesign][6] of the product. We will
also be making images focal in the app.  Although we will not be using
camera's for privacy reasons, the app experience will be amazing! Marc's
investment puts us that much closer to our goal of shipping this amazing
product as soon as we possibly can.

This new validation and support is helping us to reach our
first and most important milestone: To ship the first GeniCans.  Thank you
All-American Makers. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3b633bb8-09a9-448b-8f50-1a7948d8d843.jpg)
